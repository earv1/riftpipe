//! Gossip-mesh transport for the browser: a board is an **iroh-gossip topic**, and
//! peers broadcast `SyncMsg`s epidemically — no fixed hub, the swarm self-organizes
//! and survives any peer leaving. The N-peer-safe merge in `riftpipe_core::sync`
//! handles convergence; this module is just the transport + membership.
//!
//! Topology: the topic is the *host* EndpointId (32 bytes), so everyone opening the
//! same share link lands on the same topic. A joiner seeds the host's address (from
//! the ticket) into a memory lookup and bootstraps off it; after that, gossip
//! membership spreads and the host is no longer special.
